1-1 Review the documentation for the ping utility and answer the following questions.
  a) What is the ping utility used for.
    Sending echo requests to network hosts and receiving the response.
  b) What command-line option to ping causes it to print numerical addresses.
    -n
  c) How does the ping utility work.
    Ping uses the ICMP ECHO_REQUEST datagram, which demands an ECHO_RESPONSE from the host.
  d) How can you detect if the host 10.17.1.1 is up.
    ping 10.17.1.1, if a response is recieved it is up. Otherwise it says "Destination Host Unreachable"

1-2 Review the documentation for the traceroute utility and answer the following questions.
  a) What is the traceroute utility used for.
    To view the route packets take to reach a certain host.
  b) How does traceroute work.
    It sends packets toward the host (3 at a time), first the packets have a TTL (time to live) of 1, meaning they return instantly.
    After the first packets have returned, new packets are sent with a TTL of two, meaning they reach two nodes before returning.
    This repeats, tracing a longer and longer route until the host is reached.
  c) What command-line option causes traceroute to print numerical addresses.
    -n
  d) Use traceroute with a remote host of your choosing as the target. Explain all the output.
        traceroute to 8.8.8.8 (8.8.8.8), 30 hops max, 60 byte packets // Our target IP, it tracks maximum 30 nodes. Each packet is 60 bytes in size.
     1  130.236.64.3 (130.236.64.3)  0.385 ms  0.544 ms  0.709 ms // First column is the host name (or IP if DNS is unavilable), second column is host IP. Columns 3-5 is the round-trip-time of each packet sent.

1-3
  b) How do you display the current routing table using ip?
    ip route
1-4 Review the documentation for sysctl command and answer the following.
  a) What is a sysctl (not what does the command do, but what a sysctl actually is).
    A software utility for modifying kernel parameters.
  b) In what file can you place sysctl values so they are loaded at boot time.
    /etc/sysctl.conf
  c) Which sysctl controls IP forwarding.
    sysctl net.ipv4.ip_forward

1-5 Think of which addresses your hosts should use? Which names? Which netmasks and broadcast addresses?
  All hosts
    Netmask: 255.255.255.0
    Broadcast: 10.0.0.255

  Router
    Address: 10.0.0.1
    Name: gw

  Server
    Address: 10.0.0.2
    Name: server

  Client 1
    Address: 10.0.0.3
    Name: client-1

  Client 2
    Address: 10.0.0.4
    Name: client-2

1-6 Explain the difference between routing and forwarding (as related to IP networking).
  Routing is calculating a path for a packet through a network to a certain target. (Like planning a road trip)
  Forwarding is pushing a packet out on a particular interface. (Like going through an intersection on your road trip)

7-1 Answer the following questions.
  a) What configuration file controls NSS.
    /etc/nsswitch.conf

  b) What configuration file controls the resolver.
    /etc/resolv.conf

  c) What does the "search" keyword in the resolver configuration file do.
    Defines which domains should be searched for a host name.
    If trying to find host "myComputer" with "search example.com" in the file, we try to resolve myComputer.example.com.

7-2 Configure the resolver on all systems to use 130.236.1.9 as its name server.

7-3 Configure the name service switch on all systems to use DNS as a source for host names.

7-4 Test that name resolution works by attempting to communicate with remote-und.ida.liu.se (use ping or telnet if they are available).
