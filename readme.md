# A compilation of university projects and courses

## TDP002-Python

A course in Python and imperative programming. Contains solutions to the lab series.

## TDP003-Portfolio-Python

A project course in Python where a Flask-based webpage portfolio was created.  

## TDP004-C++

A course in C++ and object-oriented programming. Contains solutions to the lab series.

## TDP005-SFMLGame-C++

A project course in C++ where a 2D game was made using the SFML graphics libary.

## TDP007

A course in Ruby focused on programming language grammar and parsers.

## TDP019

A project course in Ruby where the programming language Automato was created.

The language is a scripting language focused on automation - inspired by AutoHotKey, with built-in functions to move the mouse and perform clicks.

## TDTS04-Networking

A networking course. Contains solutions to the lab series, which includes a web proxy.

## TDP015-Mathematics-Python

A mathematics course with a Python-based lab series focused on mathematical problems such as implementing a naive bayes classifier.

## TDDI16-DatastructuresAndAlgorithms

A C++ based datastructures and algorithms course. Contains solutions to the lab series as well as solutions to a collection of Kattis problems (https://open.kattis.com/).

## TDP013

A web programming course where a Node- and MongoDB-based social website was built. Features login, user profiles, and person-to-person socket.io-based chat.

## TDP028

An Android development course where I created an alarm app. It features login with email, Google account, or Facebook. A firebase cloud database is connected and gives your account points for every day you log on.

## TDDD49

A C# course where a peer-to-peer networked WPF chat application was developed. The application supports sending text and pictures, and keeping a log over previous chats.

## TSIU02

A course in assembly where an ATMEGA16 microcontroller was programmed. Contains solutions to the lab series. Includes a decoder for infrared input from a hexadecimal keyboard, a program that translates a string into morse-code and plays it on a piezoelectric speaker, a program based on button interrupts that displays a digital clock on four 7-segment displays with multiplexing, and a game where you with a joystick move a light onto another light on a 2D grid of LED diodes.

## TDP029-Zoezi

A search engine over available workouts built for the company Zoezi. The frontend is a React app, and the backend/middleware is a Python/Flask server using PostgreSQL as a database. I primarily contributed to the server- and database side of the project. The search engine can tolerate spleling errors and synonyms. Agile development methods were used.

## TDDD12

A database course. Contains solutions to the lab series. Lab 4 is a larger project where the database structure of a hypothetical airline was first modelled in an EER-diagram and later implemented. 

## TDIU16-Pintos

An operating systems course where we were given a version of the Pintos educational operating system, with a chunk of its features removed. The task was to implement these features using our theoretical knowledge of operating systems. Tasks included handling arguments, setting up stack pointers, implementing and securing system calls, handling keyboard input, handling processes with regards to waiting for children and handling file handles, and synchronizing the different running threads using locking mechanisms.

## TDP017

A larger project course where a smartcard-based entrance system was developed for the company Flex. A cardreader connected via BLE to our app on a tablet, which could then scan smartcards which registered the entry in a backend database. There is also an administrative frontend view. My primary contribution was to the Android application and the card reader communication.

## TDP024-Enterprise-Systems

A Java-based course focused on enterprise systems and service-oriented architecture. The first labs are smaller labs based on Git and Maven. The third lab is a larger project where three separate services were built, each with a data- logic- and API-layer. The services interact through their REST-api. Java Persistence API with Hibernate was used for database interactions.

## TDDD23-GameDesign

A course based on game design and concepts. A game was built using the Unity game engine which implemented some of those concepts and design pillars.

## TDP031-Sysadmin

A course based on configuring four virtual Linux machines (two clients, one server, one router) so they can interact with one another. Configuration included setting up the package manager, setting up the local network, setting up a DNS server, setting up network shares with appropriate user permissions so that users can log in on each machine and access their files, synchronizing network time with NTP, and creating virtual storage media with different file systems. An extensive set of tests written in bash were also created to test the specifications of the system.
