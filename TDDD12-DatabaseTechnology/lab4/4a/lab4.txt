"Route" is not in BCNF due to memory optimization and a clearer model
where only one attribute is needed to identify each route from other relations.
Pheraps this is not optimal/wrong, but that is the reasoning.

Candidate keys:
id
departure, arrival

Primary key:
id

Everything below "Route" is in BCNF with the only candidate key and primary key
being the left side of their only functional dependency
